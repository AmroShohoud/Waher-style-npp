Waher-style-npp
===============

Fork from [appel/Waher-npp-theme](https://github.com/appel/Waher-npp-theme).

Another personal repo for another version of [Waher](http://waher.net/archives/1013), the beautiful Notepad++ theme by Kristo Vaher. This fork contains the upstream Waher.xml plus a modded Waher style.

I will, too, add my support for more filetypes.
